        <h1>Project 1: Asteroids</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            <em>Asteroids</em> is a classic arcade game which debuted in
            1979 (see <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)</a>).
            As one computer science professor describes the game, it is
            "a timeless tale of triumph and sacrifice, of hatred and
            love, of space travel wrapped around our screens and our
            hearts. One solitary ship, an interminable journey, a
            violent struggle for freedom...." Before you go any farther,
            stop and play the game for a few minutes: <a
                href="http://www.freeasteroids.org">http://www.freeasteroids.org</a>
            (note: the only four control keys are the space bar and up,
            left, and right arrows). As you play, start thinking about
            the "noteworthy events" of the game&mdash;things that your
            code will have to detect and respond to.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's also fairly easy to implement, especially if you have
            help with the math. If you browse the Java API, you'll see
            that Java provides some classes very similar to what we need
            (e.g.
            <code>Point</code>
            and
            <code>Polygon</code>
            ), but for this project, we'll mostly "roll our
            own"&mdash;in part so that you can see the mathematics
            involved, in part because using the Java-provided classes in
            a game like this would require a more-complicated
            object-oriented design.
        </p>

        <p>For this project, you will be required to implement the
            basics of the game (detailed below); there is plenty of
            opportunity for extra credit, implementing 'extra' features.
        </p>

        <p>In this project repository, I'm providing you with some
            "skeleton" code. Some of it is code that you won't need to
            touch (or even understand)&mdash;code that provides the
            basic mechanics of the game graphics, for example. Some of
            it is code that you'll certainly need to modify and
            extend&mdash;I give you basic code for polygons, but how
            will you use that to create the ships and asteroids of the
            game?</p>

        <p>
            You'll get a lot of answers by reading the documentation for
            the code, either in the files themselves or as <a
                href="doc/index.html">javadocs</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Java graphics</h2>

        <p>
            For this game (like almost any video game), you will be
            forced to think about the x-y coordinate plane (be glad this
            is a 2-D game, not a 3-D one!). You may be used to a
            coordinate system where the origin (0,0) is the bottom left,
            with positive numbers going up and to the right&mdash;or you
            may be familiar with a coordinate system where the origin is
            in the middle, with positive x to the right and positive y
            above. In Java, the world is a little different: the origin
            (0,0) is the <em>top left</em> corner, positive x goes to
            the right (as 'usual'), and positive y goes <em>down</em>.
            Angles in this system are also different than you might be
            used to: "0 degrees of rotation" points to the right along
            the positive x axis (as 'usual' in geometry/trigonometry),
            but increasing degrees of rotation go <em>clockwise</em>, so
            "90 degrees of rotation" is <em>down</em> the positive y
            axis, and "270 degrees of rotation" is <em>up</em> the
            negative y axis. Stop here and draw yourself a picture.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Java, the actual drawing of things is done by a
            <code>Graphics</code>
            object, named
            <code>brush</code>
            in this code. Browse the API to see what kinds of methods
            are available to
            <code>Graphics</code>
            objects.
            <ul>
                <li>As a first step: run this skeleton code. It
                    should produce a boring black window.</li>
                <li>As a tiny second step, modify the game code to
                    draw a white line somewhere in the center of the
                    game display. (Where does this code go? What
                    method(s) will you need to do this?)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Adding Behavior</h2>

        <p>
            Most of the 'action' will be split between
            <code>Asteroid</code>
            object(s) and
            <code>Polygon</code>
            object(s). Take a look a the
            <code>Polygon</code>
            code. You don't need to master the mathematics, but look at
            the methods available (Eclipse's outline view might be
            helpful). How will the game logic make use of the
            <code>contains()</code>
            method, for example?
        </p>

        <p>
            OK, now
            <ul>
                <li>Declare a new class which will model your ship.
                    It should be a subclass of <code>Polygon</code>
                </li>
                <li>Modify your game code so that the ship appears
                    in the middle of game, "pointing" upward, just like
                    it should.</li>
            </ul>

            But the ship doesn't move. This next step is something of a
            challenge.
            <ul>
                <li>Modify your game code so that the ship starts
                    in the center of the game <i>and</i> moves upward.
                    We obviously haven't added any controls yet. Don't
                    worry about that. (What aspects of your ship will
                    change when it's in motion? How will you make sure
                    that change happens uniformly across time? Looking
                    ahead, when we add controls, your ship will need to
                    <em>accelerate</em>. What are the implications of
                    that? )
                </li>
            </ul>

            Once your ship is moving, there are two logical next steps,
            which you could tackle in any order you please:
            <ul>
                <li>Populate the game with at least a couple
                    asteroids. What about their motion?</li>
                <li>Add controls to the ship; see below</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Adding Control</h2>

            <p>
                To get our ship to respond to key-presses, it needs to <em>implement
                    an interface</em>. In particular, it needs to implement
                the
                <code>KeyListener</code>
                interface. Browse the Java API&mdash; which package is
                this in? What methods do you need to implement in order
                to correctly implement this interface? (Hint: you must
                provide an implementation of
                <code>KeyTyped()</code>
                , but your implementation should be empty. Let the other
                methods do the work.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Decide which three keys you want to use to control the
                ship. (Hint: in my experience, it's easier to work with
                the alphanumeric keys than with the arrow keys.)
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement the <code>KeyListener</code>
                        interface so that it "hears" and responds to
                        your control keys. Hint: just set boolean
                        variables indicating which key has been
                        pressed/released. Don't change the ship's
                        behavior in the interface implementation;
                        instead, test the boolean variables in the part
                        of your code that affects the ship's movement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the interface is implemented, modify
                        your game code so that your ship responds
                        properly to your controls.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Interaction</h2>

                <p>
                    Once you can control your ship, it's fair to expect
                    you to avoid those asteroids!
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modify your game code so that something
                            "appropriate" happens if your ship collides
                            with an asteroid.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <hr />

                <h2>Doing More</h2>

                <p>
                    You've now done everything you need to do to earn
                    100% on this project. Yes, there is lots more that
                    could be done! For extra credit (plus your personal
                    satisfaction), you might want to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Give your ship the ability to shoot
                            bullets.</li>
                        <li>Give those bullets the power to
                            degrade/destroy asteroids.</li>
                        <li>Give your asteroids the ability to
                            split into smaller asteroids.</li>
                        <li>Give the game the ability to keep the
                            number of asteroids on the board constant
                            (so if one is destroyed, a new one 'spawns'
                            soon after)</li>
                        <li>Or, have the number of asteroids
                            increase over time, increasing the
                            difficulty of the game</li>
                        <li>Add stars in the 'background.' Your
                            ship and the asteroids should be "in front
                            of" the stars.</li>
                        <li>Make the stars 'twinkle.'</li>
                        <li>Give your ship multiple 'lives.'</li>
                        <li>Display a running score.</li>
                        <li>Anything else you can dream of!</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <hr />
                <h2>Submission and Grading</h2>

                <p>This project is due 30 minutes before class on
                    Class 13 (October 16 for Thursday evening; October
                    22 for M/W afternoon). At that time, I will clone
                    your GitHub repository. No subsequent changes to
                    your repository will be graded.</p>
            </p>

            <p>I will communicate with you about your project
                through GitHub&mdash;at minimum, I will add comments to
                your code and push the results back to you.</p>

            <p>
                I will grade out of 100 points, allocated as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>10% Steady Work</b>. One week after you
                        receive this assignment, I will check to make
                        sure that you have made at least three
                        'substantial' commits to your GitHub repository.
                        They don't have to be large, but they need to
                        show that you're working.</li>
                    <li><p>
                            <b>20% Documentation</b>. Your project
                            should include revised documentation in the
                            doc folder. For classes/methods that you
                            don't change, you don't need to change the
                            documentation. For methods/classes that do
                            change, <em>delete</em> my doccomments and
                            replace them with your own. Yours must all
                            begin with the word
                            <code>NEW</code>
                            so that I can locate them easily. Use
                            Eclipse's "Generate Javadocs..." function to
                            generate the new documentation. Also, revise
                            the README.md to include a brief summary of
                            the methods and classes you changed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            5 of the 20 points for this section will be
                            for your "Works Cited" section. I expect you
                            will need to consult a variety of resources
                            to complete this project. Any website, book,
                            or similar resource from which you get
                            useful guidance must be listed here, along
                            with a brief description of what you got
                            from it (a bit of code? an explanation? an
                            answer to a question?). You do not need to
                            list the Java API or either of the two books
                            required/recommended for class. If you use
                            no other resources, then your "Works Cited"
                            section must simply contain the word <em>None</em>."
                            This section should appear in the README.md
                            after the method/class summary.
                        </p></li>
                    <li><b>10% Style</b>. Your code should be
                        properly formatted, with enough (but not too
                        much) whitespace. Eclipse will do most of this
                        for you; make sure you let it help you. Variable
                        names, metohd names, etc, should all be
                        "self-documenting" but not excessively long. <em>Generally</em>,
                        you can use any style you like, as long as
                        you're consistent. If you're not sure what style
                        to use, follow the <a

                        automatic formatting contradicts these
                        guidelines.</li>
                    <li><b> 50% Correctness and Efficiency </b>.
                        Does your game "play properly?" Does it offer at
                        least the minimum set of behaviors described
                        above? Does it do so efficiently, without
                        wasting computation?</li>
                    <li><b>10% Design</b>. Are the relationships
                        among your classes (and the way they interact
                        with the Java library classes) logical, clear,
                        and robust? Do they (for example) adhere to the
                        IS-A and HAS-A rules? (In future projects, this
                        will account for a larger portion of your
                        grade.) Is your code otherwise well-designed,

                It's probably clear, but just to be explicit: on this
                project, you are to work strictly <em>on your own</em>.
                Specifically, you may neither show your code to, nor
                look at the code of, anyone else taking 3120 this
                semester. You may consult online/textbook resources
                (subject to the "Documentation" requirements above). You
                may certainly consult with me. You may, if you like,
                discuss your design at a high level with other students
                ("Oh, I found the
                <code>java.foo.bar</code>
                package to be really helpful," or, "Sure, I can explain
                the geometry of a paint window to you."). I may relax
                these constraints for later projects, but for this first
                project, I want to make sure everyone digs in to
                Eclipse, GitHub, and Java.
